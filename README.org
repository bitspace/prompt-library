#+TITLE: LLM Prompting Library

* Introduction

This repository contains a collection of prompts, templates, and resources for working with Large Language Models.

These have been developed and accumulated over the course of about 18 months of using primarily Gemini and OpenAI models. The OpenAI model usage has been mostly via a Microsoft Azure AI integration at my day job. The Gemini model usage is "everything else".
